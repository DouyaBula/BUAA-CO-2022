      Number with same-slice carry load:        23
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,393 out of  15,822    8%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     1,172 out of  31,644    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,348
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,421 out of   4,348   55%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             107 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
